## THE MICROSERVICE
This customer_partner_match repository is a golang microservice for customers to find the right craftsman partner according to best rating and smallest distance.

A usecase for flooring partners experienced in wood, tiles and/or carpet has been implemented as a POC. Whatsoever, this microservice is prepare for new usecases implementation.


## Basic Info
- **Language:** Golang 1.18
- **Software Architecture:** Clean Architecture (ports and adapters)
- **Infrastructure:** Relational database (Postgres with postGIS)
- It's also available in this repository a Postman request collection (partners_floor.postman_collection.json) and a database (partners_location.sql).

## Requirements
- Golang [installation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dnTNElroug)
- Postgres with PostGIS (using PGAdmin 4) [installation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhKj-_-CCfY), [import database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C30q5i1e9KE)
- Postman (optional) [installation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eHJkcA8mTs), [import collection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzquMXmCLUQ)

## Performance
When a client searches for partners the "best match" quality is determined first on
partner's average rating and second by customer-partner distance. Consequently, the distance between client and partner is calculated for each request since the client coordinates are previously unknown.

The solution with best performance for this microservice specification is the use of a spatial database in which the distance between client and partner is calculated using the ST_DistanceSphere function according to their coordinates. The database query also:
- considers the combination of flooring services the client wants (wood, tiles and/or carpet, i.e.),
- if the client location is in the partner's great circle operating area,
- best rating partners,
- max. total number of partners and
- the database returns the selected partners ordered by rating (desc) and client-partner distance (asc).

This results in a "lean" floor domain because multiple business rules are in the query. On the other hand, it would not make sense to migrate part of the business rules from the query to the domain and lose performance.
